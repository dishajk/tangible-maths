Repository of Mathematical Models (and a few other things) that you can download and print on a 3D printer.

I. Minimal Surfaces
    1. Bour's Surface
    2. Enneper Surface
    3. Deformation of a Helicoid to a Catenoid
    4. Catalan's Surface

This is a work in progress. I will add more models as we go. I have also added them to my Thingiverse account. See [Thingiverse/dishajk](https://www.thingiverse.com/dishajk/designs). In case you print any of these, it would be nice if you can send me a picture of the *make*.
